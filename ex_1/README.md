# Java Design Patterns Exercise

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in Java, categorized into behavioral, creational, and structural patterns. Each pattern is demonstrated through specific use cases, showcasing their application and benefits.

## Project Structure

The project includes three main Java files:

1. **BehavioralPatterns.java**: Demonstrates the Observer and Strategy design patterns.
2. **CreationalPatterns.java**: Demonstrates the Singleton and Factory Method design patterns.
3. **StructuralPatterns.java**: Demonstrates the Adapter and Composite design patterns.

## Design Patterns Overview

### 1. Behavioral Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Allows a subject (e.g., Weather Station) to notify multiple observers (e.g., Displays) about state changes (e.g., temperature).
- **Strategy Pattern**: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime, allowing for interchangeable payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal).

### 2. Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance (e.g., Logger) and provides a global access point.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects (e.g., Animals) but allows subclasses to decide which type to instantiate.

### 3. Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces (e.g., Bird and Sparrow) to work together by wrapping one interface to match another.
- **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing uniform treatment of individual objects and compositions.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
