# Satellite Command System

## Overview

The Satellite Command System is a Java application that simulates the control of a satellite in orbit. Users can issue commands to change the satellite's orientation, manage solar panel status, and collect data. This project utilizes object-oriented programming principles and design patterns, specifically the Command Pattern.

## Features

- **Initialize Satellite**: Starts with default attributes.
- **Rotate**: Change the satellite's orientation (North, South, East, West).
- **Activate/Deactivate Solar Panels**: Control the status of the solar panels.
- **Collect Data**: Increment the data collected only if the solar panels are active.
- **User Interaction**: Command-line interface for user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- Java 1.8
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Command Design Pattern

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- An IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
